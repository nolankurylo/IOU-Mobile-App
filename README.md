This is a repository for a first React.js project of a React Native front end. This front-end communicates with a seperate PostgreSQL database via a Node.js API. This application is a "House Sharing" mobile app that acts as an IOU tracker for groups of people (ie. roommates). Users are able to create IOU's for group expenses as well as for actual items. Groups have access to a "In-Need-Of" board where users can add and resolve items on the list that the group is in need of. Enjoy the code!
